# TODO UnitTests
# 1. plotting functions for chamber geometry and for cooling channel cross section
# 2. test cases for 2D solver
#   2.1 test mesh (plot and give info on mesh quality)

# TODO Geometry 
# 1. change to accept arrays of cooling geometries 

# TODO RegenCooling
# 1. implement linear solver using previous point as initial guess 

# TODO FiPy
# 1. add chamber mesh
